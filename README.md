Pomodo can be used to increase your productivity in short blocks of time. The »[Pomodoro technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/)« is used throughout the world as a simple way to improve mental agility on tasks that require high amounts of concentration. The technique is very simple: Decide which task needs to be complete, start the Pomodo timer (25 minutes), work on the task until the timer is up, and finally take a small break (5 minutes) afterwards. After four sessions (»pomodori«), take a longer break (10 minutes). Easy. And thanks to Pomodo, applying the Pomodoro technique in your daily life is even easier.
